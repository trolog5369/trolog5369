## 🧠 Who I Am

I’m **Pranav Gaikwad**, an IT undergraduate who approaches software engineering as a **long-term craft**, not a race.

I don’t jump stacks.  
I don’t chase buzzwords.  
I move forward only when the **foundation is solid**.

What defines me is not the number of technologies I list, but:
- how deeply I understand what I use  
- how consistently I show up  
- how seriously I treat fundamentals  

Most people fail in this field due to impatience, not lack of ability.  
My goal is simple: **master the basics so well that advanced systems become inevitable.**

---

## 🧱 How I Learn & Build

I follow a few strict principles:

**Depth before speed**  
I don’t move on until I can explain, implement, and break what I’ve learned.

**Code over claims**  
Every concept must appear in code — as a project, refactor, or cleaner design.  
If it’s not in a repository, I don’t count it.

**Systems thinking**  
I care about why something exists, where it fails, and how it scales —  
not just how to make it work once.

This philosophy is reflected across my repositories, from simple programs to backend-focused work.

## 🛠️ What This GitHub Represents

This profile is **not a portfolio of perfection**.  
It’s a **record of progression**.

You’ll find:
- strong Java fundamentals  
- structured movement toward backend development  
- projects optimized for clarity, not flash  
- commits that reflect learning, not copying  

Some repositories may look simple. That’s intentional.  
**Simplicity is harder than complexity.**

If you’re reviewing this profile, you’re not evaluating what I know today —  
you’re evaluating **how well I compound over time**.

## 📂 Selected Work

📘 **BroCode Java**  
Core Java foundation focusing on clarity, structure, and correctness.  
🔗 https://github.com/trolog5369/brocodejava

More repositories will appear slowly — with higher standards each time.

---

## 🎯 Direction 

My direction is clear:
- become a **strong backend engineer**
- grow into a **reliable full stack developer**
- later expand into **cloud and intelligent systems**

The tools will evolve.  
The discipline will not.
