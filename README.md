## About me

I’m Pranav Gaikwad, an IT undergraduate focused on building strong backend fundamentals. I’m currently working deeply with Java core concepts, collections, and JDBC  and I prefer understanding how things work at a low level before relying on frameworks. I learn by writing code, breaking it, fixing it, and revisiting the same concepts until they feel natural. This GitHub reflects steady progress rather than shortcuts, with an emphasis on clarity, correctness, and long-term growth as a backend engineer.


---

## How I work

I follow a structured and disciplined approach to learning. I focus on fundamentals first, revisit concepts multiple times, and prefer clean, understandable solutions over rushed complexity. I document my progress through small but complete projects and incremental commits. If something exists in this repository, it reflects hands-on work and a clear understanding of why it was built that way and how it can be improved further.

## 🛠️ What This GitHub Represents

This profile is **not a portfolio of perfection**.  
It’s a **record of progression**.

You’ll find:
- strong Java fundamentals  
- structured movement toward backend development  
- projects optimized for clarity, not flash  
- commits that reflect learning, not copying  

Some repositories may look simple. That’s intentional.  
**Simplicity is harder than complexity.**

If you’re reviewing this profile, you’re not evaluating what I know today —  
you’re evaluating **how well I compound over time**.

## 🎯 Direction 

My direction is clear:
- become a **strong backend engineer**
- grow into a **reliable full stack developer**
- later expand into **cloud and intelligent systems**

The tools will evolve.  
The discipline will not.
